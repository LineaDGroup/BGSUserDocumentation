## Understanding License Cost

The cost of licenses depends on how many new users you add to your account and your payment cycle.

The payment cycle is yearly, so you will be charged once a year depending on the ammount of licenses you have active and purchased.

Proration will be applied to your purchases, so the calculation of the cost will be done as following.

1. If you still don't have licenses your first purchase will determine the starting date of the cycle.

2. When you purchase the first license this license will be the one you will use to access the system and you will be charged once a year, until you end your subscription, the cost of one license which is USD 1,188 per year.

3. As soon as you make a puarchase for additional licenses the cost will be prorated depending on the date of purchas and the starting date of the cycle, the following way.

    - If your first purchase was made on January the 1st, this will be your cycle's starting date.

    - If you purchase N licenses on July 15th there are 169 days left of the billing cycle.

    - You will pay only for the remaining days of the billing cycle.

    - N x USD 1,188 x (169/365) = USD 550 x N(number of licenses).
